## **Overview**  
This file provides the corrected version of the CSS debugging challenge. If you're stuck or want to check your answers, compare your fixed version with this solution file.

## **Key Fixes in the Solution:**  
- **Added missing units** (e.g., `px` in `font-size`, `border-radius`, and `margin`).  
- **Fixed incorrect syntax** (e.g., missing semicolons, incorrect font-family declaration, and extra spaces).  
- **Corrected CSS property values** (e.g., misspelled `solid`, proper RGB formatting).  
- **Ensured valid selectors** (e.g., removed `#` from `#main-content#`, corrected `[type="button"]`).  
- **Fixed specificity conflicts** (e.g., clarified which text color applies).  
- **Updated class names** (e.g., changed `.small-image` to `.small-cat-image` to match the updated HTML).
